<h2>Melbourne Jelly returns</h2>

<p>Working from home has its advantages, but - especially now that lockdowns hopefully a thing of the past here - it's also nice to work in the same space as others.</p>

<p>So, in a nod to Jellies of the past (hosted by <a href="http://agencyrainford.com">Agency Rainford</a>, <a href="https://www.inspire9.com">Inspire9</a> and other excellent and generous humans), I'm opening up my CBD apartment fortnightly on Fridays (as per the tradition). If you're keen to come along, give me a yell via SMS/email. The next event is on <strong>March 19th from 10am onwards</strong>.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that my space is rather limited (maybe half a dozen people before it'll feel crowded - hence I'm not broadcasting this), and not ideal if phone/video calls are a big part of your working focus. If you can only make it along for part of the day, that's completely fine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For anyone unfamiliar with <a href="http://www.workatjelly.com">Jelly</a>: it's casual coworking that pre-dates (and influenced) more formalised coworking spaces.</p>

<p>People use their own homes or small offices, inviting friends and peers around to work. Things usually err more towards being social than productive (i.e. expect distractions), but still, they're fun and a great way to take a break from working alone from home.</p>
