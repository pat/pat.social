<h2>Melbourne International Comedy Festival 2021</h2>

<p>I've put together some general recommendations into <a href="https://freelancing-gods.com/2021/03/13/micf-2021.html">a blog post</a>, as per usual. Including those acts, my extended list covers the following: <a href="https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/adam-hills" target="_blank">Adam Hills</a>, <a href="https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/ali-mcgregor-s-late-nite-variety-night" target="_blank">Ali McGregor's Late-Nite Variety-Nite Night</a>, <a href="https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/andrew-mcclelland" target="_blank">Andrew McClelland</a>, <a href="https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/woke-2-0" target="_blank">Aurelia St Clair</a>, <a href="https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/chasing-keanu-reeves" target="_blank">Diana Nguyen</a>, <a href="https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/don-t-you-know-who-i-am" target="_blank">Josh Earl</a>, <a href="https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/lano-woodley" target="_blank">Lano &amp; Woodley</a>, <a href="https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/lawrence-leung-connected" target="_blank">Lawrence Leung</a>, <a href="https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/mark-watson-and-friends-wish-you-were-here" target="_blank">Mark Watson</a>, <a href="https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/nat-s-what-i-reckon" target="_blank">Nat's What I Reckon</a>, <a href="https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/randy-feltface" target="_blank">Randy Feltface</a>, <a href="https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/ross-noble-2021-comeback-special" target="_blank">Ross Noble</a>, <a href="https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/tripod" target="_blank">Tripod</a>, and <a href="https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/zoe-coombs-marr" target="_blank">Zo√´ Coombs Marr</a>.</p>

<p>I don't think I'll see <a href="https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/wil-anderson" target="_blank">Wil Anderson</a> as I've already seen his show a few years ago - but it is <em>excellent</em>.</p>

<p>But if you would like to see some comedy with me, I've booked my own tickets to <strong>Andrew McClelland's The Very Model of a Modern Major Musical on Thursday March 25th</strong>, and <strong>Tripod on Sunday April 18th</strong>. If you're keen to catch either of those, do book tickets and join me. And if other acts that I've mentioned catch your eye, get in touch, perhaps we can go together. üòÅ</p>
